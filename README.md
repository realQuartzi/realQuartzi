I code many different "things" and for fun I make a variety of "things" such as:

- Video Games 🎮
- Discord Bots (C#, JavaScript, Python) 🤖
- Game Plugins (Minecraft, World of Warcraft) 💾
- Screeps 🐜

I also enjoy learning and working on "things" which are difficult for me so I can learn to overcome these difficulties :muscle:

I am a gamer by :sparkling_heart: and love PvP :crossed_swords:

I also Teach Unity Classes. (Unprofesionally)  
- Collected Time Teaching 6h.  
- Total Classes taught 5.
