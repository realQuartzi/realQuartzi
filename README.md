# **Hey there! 👋 I'm Quartzi**

### Game Developer | Content Creator | Unity Enthusiast 
> Passionate about recreating that nostalgic feel in games.

## 🎯 What I Do
I'm a fullstack developer with a deep specialization in Game Development. From 2D pixel art adventures to complex 3D MMORPGs, I tackle every aspect of game creation:
- **Game Systems:** Physics, State Machines, Networking, RPG mechanics
- **Multiplayer Architecture:** MMO systems, real-time networking, server optimization
- **"Full Development Cycle"**: Concept to prototype to skip go next
- **Chronically Up to Date**: Unity Alpha builds, latest .NET versions, SQLite update soon >.<

## 🚀 Notable Projects
### 🔮 Project-Fusion (Coming Soon - Open Source)
A blueprint prototype inspired by FusionFall, providing developers with a complete foundation to create their own FusionFall-style games. Core systems implemented and ready for customization.
### ⚔️ TerraFall (RPG Overhaul Mod) (Coming Soon - Open Source)
A comprehensive RPG transformation mod for Terraria that completely reimagines the gameplay experience. Built as a passion project for a slower nostalgic pace.  

*Plus numerous smaller experimental projects*
